	<h5>About The Signaling Pathways Project</h5>
	</ui:define>

	<ui:define name="body">
		<p>The goal of the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP) knowledgebase is to allow bench researchers to routinely ask sophisticated questions of the universe of multi-omics data points generated by the cellular signaling community.</p>

		<p>In our previous incarnation as the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA), we curated GEO-archived RNA-Seq and expression array, or transcriptomic, datasets involving genetic or small molecule manipulation of nuclear receptors. To allow researchers to mine this data, we developed the data mining tool Transcriptomine (Becnel, 2017). </p>

		<p>To expand this initial effort we have:
			<ul>
				<li>broadened the scope of the database to encompass datasets involving genetic and small molecule perturbation of the three major classes of mammalian cellular signaling pathway nodes: receptors, enzymes and transcription factors.</li>
				<li>integrated SRA ChIP-Seq (cistromic) data points, mapped these to the transcription factors or enzyme antigens used in the experiments, and integrated them with the transcriptomic data points</li>
				<li>developed the consensomes algorithm, which surveys across large numbers of ‘omics experiments to identify those gene targets that are most frequently regulated in response to manipulation of cellular signaling pathway nodes</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The result of these efforts is the SPP (Ochsner et al., 2019). Maybe you’re wondering what genes involved in cell cycle control are regulated by FGF receptor signaling in the liver? Or what genes are most frequently regulated by leptin receptor signaling? Or what inflammatory transcription factors might be regulating genes in your gene set of interest. SPP is the place to ask these questions.</p>
		<p>SPP is dedicated to helping researchers to make sense of the often overwhelming volume of multi-omics information in the field of cellular signaling. We invite you to follow us on Twitter and Facebook to keep up with all the latest news and to hear about upcoming community webinars in which we will be demonstrating how researchers can get the most out of SPP to validate the results of their bench experiments, generate or refine their research hypotheses, or model signaling pathways operating in their biological system of interest.</p>

		<p>To the biomedical research community,</p>
		<p>Welcome to the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) 3.0.</p>

		<p>The mission of NURSA is to accrue, develop, and communicate information that advances our understanding of the roles of nuclear receptors (NRs) in human diseases and conditions in which NRs play an integral role.  An interdisciplinary approach will result in the generation of new and complex datasets, leading to a more complete understanding of the role of NRs in the physiology and pathophysiology of common and chronic diseases including diabetes, obesity, metabolic dysregulation, response to the environment, and reproductive diseases and disorders. </p>

		<p>NURSA began in 2002 with the objective to accrue, develop and communicate information about the nuclear receptor superfamily.  Over the last ten years, NURSA has developed a website that has developed into a comprehensive source of information about nuclear receptors, and their co-regulators, ligands, and downstream targets. Through a series of integrated 'omics-scale and informatic approaches projects, NURSA has has fostered a systems biology understanding of nuclear receptor function, physiology and regulation of target gene networks in vivo.</p>

		<p>The current NURSA Hub replaces the previous NURSA structure and is co-funded by NIDDK and NICHD.  This NURSA Hub will continue to maintain the NURSA bsm pages, databases, and public portal, as well as the online peer-reviewed e-journal Nuclear Receptor Signaling (NRS).  The Hub will provide a mechanism by which the information within this discovery/validation platform can be kept current and vital and be used by the broader research community.  To provide innovative research input, the Hub will periodically solicit a series of NURSA data source projects (NDSP) from within and beyond the nuclear receptor community.  Through a multi-disciplinary approach, these projects are expected to provide insight into the physiological and pathophysiological role of nuclear receptor signaling within the context of tissue and cell specific gene regulation.  The PIs of these NDSPs will form a consortium of NURSA investigators that will contribute to the data flow to the NURSA Hub and will work together to elucidate the role of nuclear receptors in human metabolic and reproductive disease.  We encourage you to peruse the NURSA webpage and investigate the rich data resources available, to apply to the NDSP announcements, to contribute to the datasets supported by the Hub, and to read the online journal NRS.</p>

		<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
