					<h6>Neil McKenna, Ph.D.</h6>
					Dr. McKenna is a Principal Investigator for the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas Consortium and leads the NURSA informatics team. Dr. McKenna received his Ph.D. from the National University of Ireland at Galway, and trained under Dr Bert O’Malley at Baylor College of Medicine on characterization of nuclear receptor complexes. He founded the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) website in 2003 and has led its development since. In 2005 he founded the MEDLINE-indexed journal, Nuclear Receptor Signaling, of which he is currently Editor-In-Chief along with Dr. O’Malley and Dr. Ronald Evans. Dr. McKenna has previously led NURSA’s involvement in the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Disease’s Consortium Interconnectivity Network (dkCOIN, now dkNET). Dr. McKenna serves as an advisor to NIH on biomedical big data as part of the BD2K initiative, and his primary interest is in developing internet-based approaches to helping researchers share and leverage biomedical research data. He has received supplemental funding to develop a model for connecting journal articles with their associated datasets to facilitate mining of these datasets.
