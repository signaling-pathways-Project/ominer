      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experiments similar 
        in design to the coactivator yeast two-hybrid protocols were used to identify 
        molecules which mediated the repressive functions of nuclear receptors. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early cell transfection 
        experiments had shown that discrete regions of certain receptors, such 
        as thyroid hormone receptor, were sufficient to repress, or silence, reporter 
        genes when fused to DNA-binding domains of heterologous transcription 
        factors, suggesting that specific cellular factors &#8211; or corepressors 
        - might bind to these regions. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using the yeast two-hybrid 
        screen, two corepressors were isolated in rapid succession, nuclear receptor 
        corepressor, or in Geoff Rosenfeld&#8217;s laboratory, and silencing mediator 
        of retinoid and thyroid receptors, or SMRT, by Ron Evans. Alignment of 
        the two proteins indicated that they had a largely common domain structure, 
        suggesting parallels in their mode of action. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mitch Lazar&#8217;s 
        group has shown that inactive nuclear receptors recruit corepressors in 
        part through amphipathic helical peptides called CoRNR boxes, which are 
        similar to the coactivator nuclear receptor boxes. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to these 
        structural analogies, corepressors and coactivators have common functional 
        themes. The acetylation state of nucleosomes on a promoter is related 
        to the rate of transcription of the gene. Histone acetylase coactivators 
        increase the rate of acetylation, opening the nucleosome to transcription 
        factors; histone deacetylases recruited by corepressors reverse this reaction, 
        silencing transcription of the target gene.</font></p>
