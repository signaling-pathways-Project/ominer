			<strong>Abstract</strong><br />
			Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are anti-diabetic agents that are potent activators of peroxisome proliferatoractivated
receptor-γ (PPARγ). Despite their robust insulin-sensitizing effect, chronic use of TZDs can cause
untoward side effects including excessive weight gain, fluid retention, edema, and heart failure. These issues
have significantly limited the clinical use of this class of anti-diabetic drugs. Emerging evidence suggests that
these untoward side effects may involve actions of PPARγ agonists on the nervous system. However, the
mechanisms underlying putative neuron-specific PPARγ activation and side effects remains poorly understood.
Insights into this relationship may provide opportunities to develop novel PPARγ agonists with fewer adverse
effects.<br /><br />

			The vagus nerve (including both the parasympathetic motor and sensory input) innervates the heart
and is a critical modulator of cardiovascular function. Recently, we systematically profiled the expression
patterns of all known murine nuclear receptors (NRs) in laser-captured vagal sensory neurons (VSNs). We
found that several NRs, including PPARγ, were expressed at moderate to high levels in VSNs. Notably, these
include neurons that innervate the carotid body and aortic arch and convey information regarding blood oxygen
and arterial pressure to the brain for the regulation of the baroreceptor reflex. Furthermore, we found that
PPARγ expression in VSNs is nutritionally regulated and regulates diet-induced thermogenesis by modulating
parasympathetic (vagal) activities.<br /><br />

			Activation of vagal afferents affects both sympathetic and parasympathetic output to key target organs.
However, the role of NRs in vagal sensory neurons (including PPARγ activation) on cardiovascular function
following chronic TZD treatment has not been studied. We hypothesize that chronic PPARγ activation in vagal
neurons contributes to the adverse body weight and cardiovascular effects associated with TZD treatment. We
will directly test this with the following Specific Aims: <br /><br />

			Specific Aim 1. To determine whether PPARγ activation in vagal neurons contributes to excessive
			weight gain following chronic TZD treatment.<br /><br />

			We have recently found that the loss of PPARγ in Phox2b neurons leads to a decrease in body weight due to
due to an increase in diet-induced thermogenesis that involves an active reprograming of the body’s white
adipocytes towards a thermogenic, brown adipocyte cell fate. We hypothesize that PPARγ activation in Phox2b
neurons by chronic TZD treatment (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) contributes to excessive weight gain, and that
	this increase in weight will be blunted in the mice that lack PPARγ in Phox2b neurons.<br /><br />

			Specific Aim 2. To determine whether PPARγ activation in vagal neurons contributes to the adverse
			cardiovascular effects of Rosiglitazone.<br /><br />

			We have found that the loss of PPARγ in Phox2b neurons alters vagal-mediated behaviors. Given the
important role for the parasympathetic vagus nerve in the regulation of cardiovascular function, we hypothesize
that chronic activation of PPARγ in VSNs will affect cardiac physiology. To this end, we will investigate
parameters known to be clinically associated with heart failure in wildtype mice and in mice that lack PPARγ in
Phox2b neurons following chronic TZD treatment.
